## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```bash
ðŸ“¦:.
â””â”€â”€â”€test
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€java
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€page
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€runner
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€testdata
    â””â”€â”€â”€resources
```

### Test Design
- Each test in the [tests package](./src/test/java) is independent and complete.
- [BaseTest](./src/test/java/runner/BaseTest.java) class uses TestNG annotations to configure the setup and teardown processes.
    - **@BeforeClass** : Responsible for initializing the Playwright instance and launching the browser.
      It also records the environment setup, including the browser type.
    - **@BeforeMethod** : For each test method, a new browser context is created, and Playwright tracing starts.
      It ensures the user is navigated to the login page before executing the test case.
    - **@AfterMethod** : After each test method execution, screenshots and video captures (for CI failures)
      are saved into target directory.
    - **@AfterClass** : At the end of the test class, the browser and Playwright instance are closed
      to free up resources and ensure a clean state for the next test.
- For each test method, a new Playwright server is started to ensure test isolation, preventing interference
  between test instances.

### Test Execution
- The tests can be executed using *TestNG* as the test runner.
- The tests can be executed from maven test command or individual TestNG test from local after cloning the repo.

### Maven commands to run tests:
 - To run all the unit tests

`mvn clean test`

 - To run a single test class

`mvn test -Dtest=LoginPageTest`

- To run a specific methods within test classes

`mvn test -Dtest=LoginPageTest#testLogin`

- To run in Debug Mode

`mvn -X test -Dtest=LoginPageTest#testLogin`
